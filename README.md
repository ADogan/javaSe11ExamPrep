# Introduction

Java SE 11 Oracle Exams are released!

In my journey of learning the material in preparation of taking the exam I decided to collect my notes online as a website.

On the left side you will find all the exam topics taken from the following sites:
[1Z0-815](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-programmer-i/pexam_1Z0-815)
[1Z0-816](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-programmer-ii/pexam_1Z0-816).

My plan is to put an overview and a set of links + resources for every topic.

After I initialize a third party commenting system like Disqus, the pages will be open for comments by other users. Until then, you can reach me through [email](mailto:alidogan.just.for.commits+gbjs11@gmail.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ADogan).
